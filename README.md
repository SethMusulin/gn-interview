## Interview App
This is a simple boilerplate shell for creating a small application.  

Please create a small app that shows a list of appointments and details. A mockup has been provided ('appt-list.jpg'') in the root directory and a small amount of data has been provided in the '/data' directory. 

When a user clicks on the 'Info' button, the details on the right hand side should change to reflect the currently selected appointment.

### `npm start`
